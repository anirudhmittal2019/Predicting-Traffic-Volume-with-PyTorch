# Predicting-Traffic-Volume-with-PyTorch
Building PyTorch powered traffic prediction system! Using time-series skills and deep learning knowledge, we can predict hourly traffic on interstate highways, considering seasonality and trends. With exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, let's build a system to help us navigate the roads!
